This program outupts my favorite country and landmark from that country, and tests the (\) key in a String.

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases:

 - You get to know a bit about me! I have always wanted to go to New Zealand and visit the Lord of the Ring's Movie Set! 
 - Learning how to use '\' in a String.

Problems: 

I do not see any logical or runtime errors in this program.
